- 👋 Hi, I’m @cflink-ds
- 👀 I’m interested in growing my knowledge and skillsets in many different aspects of Data Science. I'm primarily interested in Machine Learning/AI and creating
-   insights into different subjects, genre, and professional arenas. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL through SSMS and MS Access, data visualization with Power BI and Excel, and how to share my knowledge and experience 
-   through Github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects that would allow me to utilize my beginners knowledge set, but also challenge me so that I can learn and
-   grow as a Data Scientist while working towards landing a job with a company that will give me hands on professional experience utilizing my data skills.
